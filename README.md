This repository contains demo projects that illustrate how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be applied to dairy and food science. The demos showcase the integration of computational modeling with food structure–function research, bridging Food Technology and Computer Science.

The repository includes two main demos:

Demo 1: Hybrid NARX-LSTM model for predicting yogurt viscosity under dynamic shear conditions.

Demo 2: Interpretable machine learning models for predicting whey protein functionality from microstructural descriptors.# AI-in-Dairy-Science
